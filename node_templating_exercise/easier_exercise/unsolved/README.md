# Profile Page

Create a full stack application with node, express, and jquery where 
there is a home page and profile page

1. Have a data object that stores information about you
2. Have a connection to your home page and your profile page within your routes
3. Have another route that will send your data object to the client side.
4. Append the information from that data object to the DOM on your profile page.

Overall, you have a main page '/' & a profile page '/profile'. The information
for your profile page will come through the data object on the server side.
