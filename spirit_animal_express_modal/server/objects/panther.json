This totem is the symbol of power, beauty and grace. If the panther has showed up, it invites you to befriend the night and work through your fears. Remember that from death, we are reborn. Panthers are comfortable keeping to themselves and find themselves connecting with other solitary individuals. Panther listens closely, but only shares just enough information to keep curious minds content. Women who have this power animal often find that they raise their children alone either because of divorce or another circumstance. Often panther will enter you life to help you awaken your inner passions, unbridle expressions and tap into suppressed talents. It is a signal to reclaim your power often after a period of pain, suffering and death on some level. This could mean that an old issue may finally be resolving, old wounds may begin to heal. Once this healing takes place, reclaiming your power is possible.","representTwo": "Panther medicine gives a broader vision and deeper vision spiritually beyond the physical realm.
