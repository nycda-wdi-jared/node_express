{"name": "eagle", "overall": "Intuition, Creativity, Strength, Courage, Hope, Resilience, Healing, Vision, Healing, Sexual Power", "representOne": "If you have ever witnessed Eagles mating, it is a sight to behold! It is a powerful sky dancing ritual. The Eagles soar through the sky looping, plunging and diving. At a certain point the Eagles grab each other’s feet and lock talons. They begin falling and rolling as they mate. They then separate, soar high and start the process all over and again. This ritualistic mating process has been associated with danger, excitement, the power of sexual energy, and mystical joy. If the Eagle spirit animal brings you a message about sexuality, it may be telling you to open to new sexual experiences, thrills and heights of pleasure!","representTwo": "To see an Eagle in your dreams is essentially a call for introspection and self-examination. To dream of a soaring Eagle means it’s time to listen more closely to your inner voice — or intuition. To watch this power animal going from a perched stance to flight is indicative of your ability to rise above your situation, take a broader view of your circumstances, and allow your higher consciousness to guide you. However, if the power animal is diving or swooping, it can mean deception. Be mindful that everything you do comes back around, so try not to harm others in your pursuit to improve your circumstances. And if the Eagle is on the offensive and attacks, it is time to reevaluate your perceived limitations and self-imposed boundaries. You could very well be what’s holding you back."}
