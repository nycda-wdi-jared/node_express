{"name":"dolphin", "overall": "Peace and harmony; Protection; Playfulness and joy; Resurrection; Inner Strength; Cooperation","representOne": "Dolphins balance their animal nature with a higher intelligence. They trust their instincts and intuition rather than overthinking things. They live peacefully with other species, including humans. It isnâ€™t uncommon for dolphins to swim and play around swimmers and boats. Their gentle natures remind us to look for the good in everyone and strive to bring peace to our lives and those around us.","representTwo": "Sailors have long believed that dolphins are a good omen. Dolphins have been known to assist drowning people and to chase sharks away from people in the water. In one notable case, a pod of whales was beached in New Zealand. People were fighting to keep them alive but the whales were disoriented. A nearby pod of dolphins came over and herded the whales back to sea, saving their lives. Due to this tendency, dolphins have a well-earned reputation as protectors. They teach us to not only save ourselves, but to protect others in need."}
