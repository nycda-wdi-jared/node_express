1. Look at the commented out code throughout the application
2. Pseudo Code:
	* Make your server-side routes
	* Connected those routes to the client side
	* Make sure the ajax get route loads up the object sent from the server side when the page loads
	* Make sure that when the post is sent, the object is sent, you can test this out through the ui or postman
	* For the post on the server side, console.log(req.body). Make sure that comes through correctly. Then, write your conditionals to change the values appropriately
	* When you are sending back the post response to the client side, make sure that is coming out correctly on the client side
	* Append the changed information to the html
