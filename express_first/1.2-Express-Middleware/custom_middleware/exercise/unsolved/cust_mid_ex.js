/*

• Create middleware for the earlier examples to make a log of incoming requests. 
  Include the original route and a timestamp. Have the log write to a file called "log.txt" 
  in your project directory.
  Date.now()
• Hint: the original route for the request is on request.originalUrl.
BONUS: every time you hit a route, the log.txt gets replace. instead of replacing,
       append all of the routes to the file. We want to see all of them ;)
