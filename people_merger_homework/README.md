<h1>Goal:</h1>

Develop a program that uses Node's fs library to manipulate local files.

<h1>Assignment:</h1>

I don't know about you but creating a program that can read from one file and write to another sounds pretty cool! Depending on the task, it can also save you a lot of time.

For this assignment, you'll be creating a program that can read from multiple files and writes a new file using that data.

<strong>Below are detailed instructions for your program:</strong></br>
* Read in a file, named "people1.jsonView in a new window", which contains a list of people.</br>
* Read in another file, named "people2.jsonView in a new window", which contains another list of people.</br>
* After both of these files have been read, write a new file called "peopleComplete.txt" which contains a sorted list of all the people from the first two files.

<strong>Bonus:</strong></br>
Read in the files from a people directory, and merge all of the files in the directory into a "peopleComplete.json" file

<strong>Grading Criteria:</strong></br>
* The program reads from both the"people1.jsonView in a new window" and"people2.jsonView in a new window" files.</br>
* The program writes a new file called "peopleComplete.txt" which contains all the people from the first two files.</br>
* The list of people in the "peopleComplete.txt" is sorted.

<strong>Complete</strong> = Meets all grading criteria above.
<strong>Incomplete</strong> = Does not meet all grading criteria above. Needs improvement or missing submission.
